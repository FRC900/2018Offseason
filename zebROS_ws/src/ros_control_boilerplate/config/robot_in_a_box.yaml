# Settings for ros_control hardware interface
# Map a name for each valid joint to a CAN id
# For future expansion, change hw_id to specify one
# of several types of HW interface : CAN_id, PWM_id, DIO_id, AIO_id, etc.

# Create controllers for each joint
#
# Entry is the name of the controller. It can be anything.  
# It will create a namespace with that name under the main
# controller namespace. Subscribed topics for that controller
# will be most often show up under 
# <top level controller manager ns>/<controller ns>/topic
# e.g.
# /frcrobot/joint1_talon_controller/command
# /frcrobot/joint2_talon_controller/command
# /frcrobot/talon_states
#
# This one creates the /talon_states topic necessary in ROS
# It doesn't actually control anything, just takes the internal
# encoder state used by the hw manager and publishes it as
# a ROS topic.  This is generic ROS stuff, so we'll have
# to figure out what to map e.g. effort to in the Talon world

# Similar to above, but this one prints non-Talon state
# (stuff that fits into the more standard ROS position/


# Create a controller called talon1_controller
#  That name is used by spawner in the launch file to 
#  actually start this controller
# The joint it controls is talon_1. This should match
# up with one of the names in the top-level joints list
# above.  
# The type is a talon_controllers/TalonController
