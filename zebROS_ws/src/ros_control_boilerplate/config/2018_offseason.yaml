# Settings for ros_control hardware interface

# Create controllers for each joint
#
# Entry is the name of the controller. It can be anything.  
# It will create a namespace with that name under the main
# controller namespace. Subscribed topics for that controller
# will be most often show up under 
# <top level controller manager ns>/<controller ns>/topic
# e.g.
# /frcrobot/joint1_talon_controller/command
# /frcrobot/joint2_talon_controller/command
# /frcrobot/talon_states
#
# This one creates the /talon_states topic necessary in ROS
# It doesn't actually control anything, just takes the internal
# encoder state used by the hw manager and publishes it as
# a ROS topic.  This is generic ROS stuff, so we'll have
# to figure out what to map e.g. effort to in the Talon world
